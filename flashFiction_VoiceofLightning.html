&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I was struck by lightning. Captivated by the danger of her ephemeral beauty; the crackling static surrounding her like an explosive halo, the brilliant sparks threaded through her hair, the riveting contrast of her white-hot skin against the bruised gray of the clouds. She wasn’t human. No, anything but that. Humans don’t leap from the hearts of storms in delight. Humans don’t close their eyes to embrace the unexplainable presence in the air when the sea falls into chaos with the sky.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She didn’t notice me at first. The earth was soft and the thick rolls of thunder swept all sound beneath the roaring waves climbing the cliffs below. I had been standing far behind in the shelter of the jagged rocks, transfixed by the sharp flicker of her body; every few seconds the darkness swallowed her whole, as if she were nothing more than a glitch of light amidst the confining shadow. The burning afterimage of her silhouette multiplied through the night until it could have dimmed even the stars.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I’d thought myself well-hidden — a quiet spectator to the spellbinding ritual of an otherworldly being. But then she spoke to me from the very edge of the precipice; face turned to the slash of horizon scarcely visible through the murky charcoal of the sky.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Your kind is Empty,” she said. Her voice rang like silver bells. “Mine is Absolute.” She stilled: a statue among swirls of disarray. In a flash, her head was angled towards me, and I was electrified. Her eyes were pure white, from corner to corner. I’d never seen anything so simultaneously terrifying and beautiful; I couldn’t look away. “Aren’t you afraid?” she asked.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I didn’t dare speak. Her teeth looked like pearl daggers. I could imagine them tearing into the soft flesh beneath my ribs and tracing up each vertebrae of my spine. Maybe if I let her, my insipidity would flare into an inferno worthy of the storm’s consideration.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Perhaps you should be.” She crossed the distance between us as if it were nothing, feet soundless on stone, and cupped her cool hands around my face. The world had gone silent — even the stars held their breath, the tension strung between two starkly different souls too mesmerizing to turn from. With a gentle breath smelling of smolder, she brushed her fingertips over my eyelids. I leaned into the touch before I remembered that lightning could strike.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The force of it knocked me senseless to the ground, awe working its way into my mouth in the form of melting iron; there had never been a more bittersweet taste. She stepped back, leaving me grasping at soil, struggling to renounce the weight of a leaden mind.<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Darkness will always bow before light,” she hissed, features contorting as her words fell beside me in the dirt. “For without the blaze of the stars and fire leaping in the night, the Earth would be eaten by its own shadow.”<br>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She smiled then; the sight of it burned my eyes until all I could see was white.
