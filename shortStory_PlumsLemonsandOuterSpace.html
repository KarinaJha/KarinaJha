<i>Stop 1</i><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;On Tuesdays, I take the 5:24pm bus from Thornhill Station to North Linden Ave. The walk from my office building to the station is approximately 11 minutes, so I leave work at 5:05pm and typically arrive with 8 minutes to spare. I wait on the bench on the 9th platform that has 3 cracks running down its back and green paint peeling off the left armrest. Very few people wait for the 5:24pm train on the 9th platform of Thornhill Station, so over time I’ve become familiar with their faces.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There is a student. 2 yellow pencils hold a knot of chestnut curls on the top of her head. Her dusty sneakers shift and squeak on the platform tiles, tapping out impatient rhythms. She chews at her lower lip and often leans over the painted safety line to squint at the point where the train tracks vanish. Her phone is always tucked into the back right pocket of her jeans, though periodically she will take it out to swipe and jab furiously at the little screen before replacing it with a huff of frustration.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There is a businessman. The lines of his suit are pressed crisply, and he always arrives with less than 2 minutes to spare and a sandwich in a grease-stained paper bag. He never sits down. Instead, he sets his briefcase at his feet and carefully opens the bag to examine its contents. He pulls out a small salt-and-pepper packet and throws it into the garbage can next to the platform entrance. Afterwards, he gives a nod of self-satisfaction, picks up his briefcase, and then (as if in suspicion of a witness to his little ritual) scans the platform with shifty eyes, pausing momentarily on the great clock hanging on the opposite side of the tracks.<br>
There is a teacher. She has 3 bags slung over her shoulders that pull her posture into a droop and a school ID dangling from a lanyard around her neck. Every 30 seconds or so, she will either yawn or give a great sigh, settling against the back of the bench she occupies with an inexpressible exhaustion. It wrinkles the skin of her forehead and the space between her brows, loosens the rigidity of her neck, tugs at her eyelids. Occasionally, she dozes off and one of her bags slides to the floor with a soft thunk. The sound jerks her awake and for a few dazed moments she will sit and rub pensively at her temples before pulling it back into her lap.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;There is a musician. A black guitar case is strapped to his back and covered in an assortment of colorful stickers. He leans against the wall about 5 feet from the bench where I sit and nods along to music escaping tinnily from his headphones. Every now and then he will close his eyes and hum along softly, a smile curving his lips. He wears a large gray hoodie with a frayed bottom seam and he winds and unwinds the threads around his thumb (4 winds, 4 unwinds). On rainy days, he trudges dejectedly to his waiting place; the guitar replaced with 2 bright yellow rain boots and a sour expression.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Today, the train arrives one and a half minutes late due to “unexpected delays” on the East Line. The force of its passing as it screeches to a halt ruffles my hair and scatters bits of garbage on the ground. With a harsh squeal, the doors grind open and approximately 11 people pour out onto the platform. Once they have all disembarked, I step onto the train, climb the narrow metal stairs, and settle into the window seat in the 3rd row on the left side of the aisle. From here, I have a clear view of the tracks ahead and the positions of the 7 other passengers in the train car. I place my backpack on the floor between my feet and fold my hands in my lap.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Slowly, the train begins to move, gaining speed until the scenery outside the window morphs into a muted blur. The sky is gray and overcast; clouds indiscernible, trees passing by at 64 miles per hour, the rails clicking faintly beneath the train’s wheels (1.5 clicks per second on average). I twist my fingers and glance around the car. Everything and everyone is quiet (except for the tracks — 11, 12, 13 clicks and counting). It is the right kind of day. I twist my fingers harder.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It is the right kind of day to kill myself.
<p></p>
<i>Stop 2</i><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It’s a beautiful autumn evening and yet I couldn’t be in a worse mood. Last night, my roommate and I got into a fight and she’s been sending me obnoxiously passive-aggressive texts all day. Her message boils down to: “If you don’t buy the skim milk for the coffee tonight, I’m never speaking to you again.” So here I am, already dead tired on Tuesday and walking in the cold to buy (drumroll, please)... milk. Sorry, I mean <i>skim</i> milk. I’d get all sorts of hell for buying the wrong kind of <i>milk</i>.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Even with my coat collar turned all the way up, the wind still slips in and spreads chills down my back and up my arms. Dried leaves the color of burnished gold and rust dance around my feet, twirling and tumbling along the curb. The cold has been bringing earlier nights with it: at 6:00pm the sky is already washed vivid amber and violet. Clouds fade into the dark as it creeps from the east, swallowing the remnants of the day. I could sit and stare at the sky for hours.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But I have to buy milk.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A train rushes past me, rattling the tracks beneath it, and I watch until its taillights blend into the evening traffic. I used to take the train to work. Now, I walk from my tiny flat to my boring job in the stubborn belief that I’m saving some substantial amount of money and effort in the long run. (I’m not.) I don’t mind the walks, though. When the weather is nice and I’ve gotten my morning dose of caffeine, the world looks considerably brighter and the people appear considerably friendlier.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Today however, even the most magnificent sunset couldn’t lift me entirely out of my low spirits. I’m absolutely exhausted, and instead of a cozy, blanket-piled bed waiting immediately for me at the flat, there’s only slews of research, missed deadlines and assignments, pushy emails, steep bills, and disappointment in the form of my mother’s flat voice over the phone.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It isn’t easy. But it’s better than that house. Anything is better than that house.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I can see the convenience store coming up around the corner, its lights bleeding onto the parking lot asphalt in shimmering swaths. The streetlights tower like evening sentinels, the cars lined up like tin soldiers at their posts. Through the windows, the inside of the store looks like another world; orderly lines of colorful boxes and cans, each sporting flashy labels designed to catch the wandering eye. It’s funny how something so mundane can change when seen under a different sky. Although I suppose your mind animates everything when it can’t stand the lifelessness of reality.
<p></p>
<i>Stop 3</i><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am the 4th passenger to get off the train on Tuesdays. 1st is the teacher. She loops her 3 bags through her elbow and pulls herself up with a great, unseen weight on her back and a hoarse sigh. She hobbles down the aisle and steps off the train with care. There is no one to meet her at the station. 2nd is the businessman. When he stands up from his seat, he smooths the crisply-ironed line of his pants and pats his right coat pocket. The station he gets off at is often relatively full; he is quickly swallowed by the crowd upon disembarkment. 3rd is the musician. His guitar case brushes the tops of every other aisle seat as he strides towards the train’s doors. He hops from the 5th metal step with a flourish and bounds over to greet someone holding a bag overflowing with sheet music. Their voices are muffled from behind the glass.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The train pulls away from the musician’s station and I spare a glance at the map pasted on the wall two rows ahead of me. In 2 stops, I will get off the train and walk to the convenience store on the corner of Rosen and Meadow St. There, I will buy one pack of mint gum (kept on the 3rd shelf beneath the checkout counter), and walk back past the station. At 6:48pm, a train to Ridgemont crosses the path to my apartment building. Every week I hear it as I walk down Bayberry St. I see the fluorescent-lit interior through its windows and illumination of its headlights on the hulking trees at the edge of Summit Park. But today (unlike every other Tuesday) I will wait for it. This time I will meet the train on the tracks.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;My stop is called Meadow St. Station. When I stand up, the student peers at me from behind a curtain of curls and smiles absently. For 1 second, I pause. But her attention flips back to the phone in her hand; the smile twisting into an irritated scowl. I get off the train just as the doors begin to close.<br>
<p></p>
<i>Stop 4</i><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The convenience store is eerily empty. A very bored-looking teenager sits behind the counter, dejectedly pushing buttons on the cash register. Behind him, ad-plastered slushie machines line the wall, their glow transforming the edges of his hair into a rainbow of neon. He looks like a scruffy nightclub angel dropped into the wrong dimension. I snort a little too loudly and he looks up at me, eyes narrowed in suspicion.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Shoving my hands into my coat pockets, I duck into the refrigerated aisle and scan the dented, frost-covered boxes lined up behind glass. Frozen peas (inarguably disgusting), boxed waffles and pizza, ice-cream bars, a pack of crackers that is clearly not where it should be, cheap off-brand yogurt, and (at the very end of the aisle, naturally) milk.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Skim milk, skim milk… <i>there</i> it is.” I snag a carton and start back towards the front of the store, examining the label. I’m about halfway down the aisle when I hear the ugly jangle of the bells over the store entrance and a set of footsteps.<br>
A darkly-dressed figure stands at the counter, hood pulled up and hands covered with patchy black gloves. I let out an internal groan. Of course there’s only a line when I’m done. Stepping into place behind Hoodie, I pull out my phone and check the time. 6:34pm already, and I still have to get home in time to make dinner or my roommate will pitch yet another fit.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Is that all?”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Yes.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I flick my attention back to the hooded figure in front of me. They speak quietly and tap their fingers against the countertop (3 taps on the right hand, 3 taps on the left hand).<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“One pack of mint gum… let’s see. That’ll be uh… a dollar ninety-nine.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Hoodie neatly slides a twenty across the counter, slips the gum into their pocket, and spins on their heel, heading straight for the door. The clerk kid doesn’t even notice, his barely-open eyes trained on the cash register display screen. I frown.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Hey!” I call. Hoodie pauses, nearly out the door already. “Don’t you want your change?”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The figure turns around and I freeze. It’s a girl about my age — maybe just a few years younger. Her hair is mussed, several loose strands hanging limply over her face, and there’s a smudge of what looks like charcoal dust across her cheekbone. Her eyes are deep brown, fringed with thick lashes, underlined with half-circles of bruised gray. But they’re entirely empty.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;My breath hitches in my throat. I know that look. I know it too well. Those are the eyes that would look back at me in the bedroom mirror when— after—<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For a split second, I see it all over again. The lock turning on the door, his hands reaching, the tears dripping onto the bed sheets. I feel sick.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Keep it,” she says, and disappears into the dark outside. I want to follow her. I need to follow her.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Okay, so you’ve got a carton of milk and a packet of…” The clerk’s voice jerks me back to reality and I spin to face him.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Crackers,” I whisper, the girl’s eyes still burning in my mind. “They’re crackers.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I feel numb as I pay, jam the change into my pocket, and grab the plastic bag with the milk and crackers from the cashier’s hand.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Have a nice day,” he drones as I pull open the door and stumble into the night. I hear the bells behind me but this time there is no ring. There is only a horrible, jarring crash.
<p></p>
<i>Stop 5</i><br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;They are not far from each other, not really. One walks to the train tracks, her fingers curled around the pack of gum in her coat, senses dull to everything except the metal rungs that will lead her to stillness. The other searches the shadows, memories under lock and key, her traitorous heart leading her into the temptations of danger.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Humanity will be their downfall. But for now, they are just children without a hand to hold in the night.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The air is cold and at this hour, the moon has already risen to kiss the clouds above. Light gleams off the rails as the number-stricken girl steps into their perfectly parallel embrace. She lets out a slow breath, surrendering herself to the trees and the gravel and the metal stretching further than she can see. It is 6:41pm.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A branch snaps and she tips her head to face the sound. It is the Other Girl — the one who holds heart over logic. In the moment they meet one another’s gaze, there has never been a fuller silence. It runs over with unnameable things and the hushed music of a leafless forest.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“You,” the Other Girl says, and lets the plastic bag fall to the ground. “In the store—”<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Leave.” The Half Girl’s voice is listless.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;A hesitation. “I just wanted to—”<br>
   &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; “Leave,” she repeats.<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Other Girl bites her tongue but does not move. Seconds pass that feel like hours. Finally, she makes the decision she will never have the chance to regret. She steps onto the tracks and faces the girl without a heart.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I see you,” she says, and despite her low tone, the words cut through the wind like a blade. In the eyes of the heartless, she sees the words cut, too. “I’m sorry if this is strange, I just… That moment in the store when you looked at me, I saw— I mean, I felt like I knew you. Or rather, I knew what you felt. Somehow... I think we’re the same.” The silence wraps tighter around them, and the Other Girl struggles to fill it. “What I’m trying to say is, I think we can help each other.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I have no interest in that.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“If I’m right and we’re anything alike—” the Other Girl pauses and looks down at the rails. “If we’re anything alike, you won’t last the night.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“The night is long; sunrise is in 12 hours and 17 minutes. That’s plenty of time for you to get home.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“You won’t listen.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“I told you to leave.” A ghostly smile crosses the Half Girl’s lips. “Strangers don’t help strangers in the dark.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“But I want to—”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“It makes me sick,” she interrupts. “When people don’t count their words.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Beneath them the tracks begin to tremble, but neither notices yet. The train approaches; the independent variable, the indisputable authority of the narrative. Its wheels tear against metal, sparks leaping into the black. Any other day, its timeliness would be something to admire. Today, its lack thereof is something to despise. The trees press closer, stifling the headlights’ announcement.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i>1.5 minutes</i>, whispers one girl’s brain. She squares her shoulders. “Move out of the way.”<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Other Girl doesn’t budge.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“Move.” The Half Girl strides towards her, arms outstretched, and steers her off the rails. But she steps right back on.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;“No,” says the Other girl, and this time her eyes burn brighter than anything that could be imagined in emptiness. The train advances; the trees can only hold it for so long.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Half Girl feels the pulse first. It’s the suggestion of a heartbeat, growing more insistent with each pound. She checks her watch, but she already knows. She knew from the beginning. To expect perfection from the world is too great of a wish. It listens only to the pleas of the Whole. Yet she is granted one small favor; just briefly, time stops for her to assess the situation: the tracks, the moon, the seconds ticking by. She makes her decision. But she will find one fatal mistake in her calculations.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;She has forgotten to account for the intentions of others.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It unfolds in a systematic series of events. Headlights cleave the night, two girls spin (rails shaking, wheels groaning, moon shining), one closes her eyes, the train blares, the trees scream, fingers twine together, a smile—<br>
<p></p>
<i>Stop 6</i><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;    I’m sorry, you were probably expecting something else.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i>3 seconds swallowed by the earth.</i><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;But there are no happy endings here.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>   2 hands clasped in the dark.</i><br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Wasn’t it made clear?<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;  <i>  1 pack of mint gum thrown across the gravel.</i><br>
 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;   Humanity does not meet well with sacrifice.<br>
 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; <i>  The time is 6:47pm.</i>
